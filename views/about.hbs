                Hi, my name is Axel Dalbard and I am 20 years old. I am a sophomore studying Computer Science: Software
                Development and Mobile Platforms at JU.
                <br>
                I was born in France and moved to Sweden at the age of 9 to a city called Nyk√∂ping. I chose to study
                Computer Science because I've always had an interest for technology and computers.
                <br>
                In my spare time I like to make music, go to the gym and hang out
                with my friends.
            </p>
